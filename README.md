# Data Visualization Exploration

In this project, I explore the techniques and principles behind data visualization. I used datasets from the following repositories. 

Data Sources:
<br>
<br>
    [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
<br>    
    [KDD Archive](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/)
<br>    
    [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
<br>    
    [DELVE Datasets by the University of Toronto](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/datasets.html)
<br>    
    [StatLib Datasets by Carnegie Mellon University](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/)

Visualizations:

    Line, Scatter, Bar, Pie, and Bubble Charts
    Sankey Diagram, TreeMap, Histogram, Parallel Coordinates
    Box Plot, Heatmap, Network Graph, Radar Chart

I carefully selected each chart to clearly show the data's key patterns and insights, helping to better understand different ways to visualize data.
